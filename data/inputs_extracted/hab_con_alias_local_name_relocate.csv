1,Tributary to Kerry Lake,198692_us,Site 198692_us. Significant flow for this time of year. Patches of gravel were present suitable for spawning resident rainbow trout and bull trout. Rainbow trout were captured during sampling. Healthy riparian of mixed forest and shrub. The stream narrowed into a canyon roughly 150m upstream of Kerry FSR. Surveyed to approximately 300 m upstream of the Kerry FSR.          11:43:48
2,Tributary to Kerry Lake,198692_ds,Site 198692_ds. Stream was surveyed from Kerry FSR downstream for approximately 230m. There were frequent deep pools providing cover for resident fish and gravels present for spawning. Lots of complex habitat providing cover for fish. Fish (~50mm) observed in pools.  Stream frequently goes subsurface starting around 200m downstream of the crossing. 14:27:16
3,Tributary to McLeod Lake,198669_us,Site 198669_us. Stream was surveyed for 550m upstream of the crossing. Abundant gravels throughout. Channel turns to predominantly fine substrates at the powerline corridor. Then there is a beaver dam (1.2 m high) backwater area approximately 100 m upstream of the transmission line. Numerous fish between 40 mm and 120 mm were observed up to the beaver dam and RB are documented upstream in FISS. Upstream of the dam impounded area the stream returns to predominantly gravel with frequent pools to 40 cm deep.          15:22:55
4,Tributary to McLeod lake,198669_ds,"Site 198669_ds. Frequent pools with good cover present for overwintering fish. Gravels present for spawning. Beaver activity is visible. The stream was surveyed from the Hart highway down to McLeod lake, roughly 250m. Fish were observed the entire length of the survey. Overall good habitat.16:35:12"
5,Tributary to Missinka River,125180_us_ef1,Site 125180_us_ef1. Set stop nets ~3m upstream of the culvert inlet. Fished from culvert up to a deep pool with a ~1m debris jam drop. Site length ~30-35m. See gps. 12:46:55
6,Tributary to Missinka River,125180_ds_ef1,"Site 125180_ds_ef1. Electrofished with stop nets from approximately 35-40 m downstream, up to the culvert outlet. Sampled this site assuming it would be a reference site, but the culvert appeared to be embedded and perhaps not as much of a barrier as when inventory in 2019, therefore this site should not be a reference site. For this reason, we only measured the length of fish and did not pit tag or weigh.          10:21:16"
7,Tributary to Missinka River,125194_ds_ef1,Site 125194_ds_ef1. Fish sampling site only. No fish were captured. This is a 2022 habitat confirmation site follow-up.  Some channel/wetted width estimates were taken at the bottom end of the site. Suspect subsurface and/or beaver dam complexes have fragmented this area - disconnecting the stream from the Missinka River at this time. 15:29:13
8,Tributary to Missinka River,125179_ds_ef1,Site 125179_ds_ef1. Site is approximately 35 m long. The bottom of site is marked with pink flagging and labeled. The top of the site is under the bridge in the middle. Mostly riffle habitat with some pools. Three visual observations of fish that were not captured.                    11:24:14
9,Tributary to Missinka River,125179_us_ef1,"Site 125179_us_ef1. Site is approximately 40 m long. The bottom of the site was in the middle of the bridge and the top of the site was at a small 40 cm high debris. The top of the site was marked and labelled with pink flagging. The form photos were not functioning properly, so see the camera roll for the upstream and downstream ends of the site.13:43:12"
10,Tributary to Missinka River,125180_ds_ef2,"Site 125180_ds_ef2. This site was fished a couple of days earlier (125180_ds_ef1) but fish were not tagged or weighed. The crew returned to the site to capture fish for tagging. Started fishing roughly 30m downstream of the culvert, below the big bend corner. The site had several deep pools to 40 cm deep. Initially fished only a 20 m section from upstream of the corner but then moved the bottom of the site downstream approximately 8 m to get more fish for tagging. 15:08:26"
11,Tributary to Table River,125231_ds_ef1,"Site 125231_ds_ef1. This was a newly installed bridge in 2024. The downstream end of the site is marked with pink flagging on the right bank. The bottom of the site was approximately 1-2 m upstream of 4 logs across the stream at a location of a riffle break. The top of the site is in the middle of the bridge underneath the bridge structure. Nets were set up at both upstream and downstream ends of the site. Habitat was mostly riffle with a few large cobble lines, where only the few taggable sized fish were captured. Basically no fish were captured within the construction footprint due to little complexity, except for the odd boulders from construction.          10:35:33"
12,Tributary to Table River,125231_us_ef1,Site 125231_us_ef1. The bottom of the site was in the middle of the bridge and had a stop net. The top of the site was marked with flagging and a waypoint. It appears that only the bottom 15-20 m of the site was disturbed by the construction. See camera roll for more photos as form photos were not functioning correctly.          12:30:33
13,Tributary to Table River,125231_ds_ef2,Site 125231_ds_ef2. This was a newly installed bridge in 2024. The bottom of the site was located just downstream of pool and was marked with pink flagging. The top of the site is at the middle of the bridge and is the bottom of 125231_us_ef1. We fished this additional site (ef2) to collect more fish for tagging to monitor movement and health after the replacement. 14:29:37
14,Fern Creek,125261_ds_ef1,Site 125261_ds_ef1. The bottom of the site is just above two fallen logs that go all the way across the stream. The top of the site boundary is a clump of three conifers across the stream. Downstream and upstream ends were flagged. 10:02:39
15,Fern Creek,125261_ds_ef2,Site 125261_ds_ef2. The site begins upstream of three logs that have fallen across the stream and is flagged with pink flagging tape (top of 125261_ds_ef1). The top of the site is approximately 1.5 m metres below the outlet of the culvert under the FSR. Did not fish immediately below the steel pipes to avoid electrical damage to fish. 11:22:21
16,Fern Creek,125261_us_ef1,Site 125261_us_ef1. The bottom of the site is just upstream of the culvert inlet. There was stop net set up at the bottom of the site but some flow went over the top before we checked the net. The top of site is a beaver dam. 12:51:52
17,Fern Creek,125261_us_ef2,"Site 125261_us_ef2. The bottom of the site is located 1m upstream of a small beaver dam, has a stop net, and is flagged. The top of the site was a natural riffle break with small woody debris and was also flagged. The site was mainly beaver impounded habitat to 50 cm deep with abundant small debris and some large woody debris. 14:32:58"
18,Tributary to Kerry Lake,198692_ds_ef1,"Site 198692_ds_ef1. The downstream end of this site was just upstream of the first deep pool after the outlet pool. The bottom and top ends of the site were flagged. Shallow, almost intermittent riffle sections, with only small fish captured.          10:47:36"
19,Tributary to Kerry Lake,198692_ds_ef2,Site 198692_ds_ef2. This site consisted of just the outlet pool of the culvert. The outlet pool is extremely deep and was full of fish. 10:59:43
20,Tributary to Kerry Lake,198692_us_ef1,"Site 198692_us_ef1. The bottom end of the site is the inlet of the culvert, where we placed a net. The top end of sight is approximately 2 m upstream of the end of a large spruce tree that has fallen into the channel. Mostly very shallow riffle habitat except for one mellow pool area with undercut banks and small woody debris where most of the 60mm plus sized (tag-size) fish were captured.          14:17:01"
