The stream had good flow for time of year and during an uncharacteristically dry/hot spring and summer. Patches of gravel were present suitable for spawning resident rainbow trout and bull trout. Rainbow trout were captured during sampling. Healthy riparian of mixed forest and shrub. The stream narrowed into a canyon roughly 150m upstream of Kerry FSR. Surveyed to approximately 300 m upstream of the Kerry FSR.          11:43:48

Stream was surveyed from Kerry FSR downstream for approximately 230m. There were frequent deep pools providing cover for resident fish and gravels present for spawning. Lots of complex habitat providing cover for fish. Fish (~50mm) observed in pools.  Stream frequently goes subsurface starting around 200m downstream of the crossing. 14:27:16

Stream was surveyed for 550m upstream of the crossing. Abundant gravels throughout. Channel turns to predominantly fine substrates at the powerline corridor. Then there is a beaver dam (1.2 m high) backwater area approximately 100 m upstream of the transmission line. Numerous fish between 40 mm and 120 mm were observed up to the beaver dam and RB are documented upstream in FISS. Upstream of the dam impounded area the stream returns to predominantly gravel with frequent pools to 40 cm deep.          15:22:55

Frequent pools with good cover present for overwintering fish. Gravels present for spawning. Beaver activity is visible. The stream was surveyed from the Hart highway down to McLeod lake, roughly 250m. Fish were observed the entire length of the survey. Overall good habitat.16:35:12"
