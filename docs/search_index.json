"],["introduction.html", "1 Introduction", " 1 Introduction The health and viability of freshwater fish populations can depend on access to tributary and off channel areas which provide refuge during high flows, opportunities for foraging, overwintering habitat, spawning habitat and summer rearing habitat (Bramblett et al. 2002; Swales and Levings 1989; Diebel et al. 2015). Culverts can present barriers to fish migration due to low water depth, increased water velocity, turbulence, a vertical drop at the culvert outlet and/or maintenance issues (Slaney, Zaldokas, and Watershed Restoration Program (B.C.) 1997; Cote et al. 2005). As road crossing structures are commonly upgraded or removed there are numerous opportunities to restore connectivity by ensuring that fish passage considerations are incorporated into repair, replacement, relocation and deactivation designs. The Society for Ecosystem Restoration in Northern BC (SERNbc) is working together with the McLeod Lake Indian Band, the Peace Region Fish and Wildlife Compensation Program (FWCP), the Provincial Fish Passage Technical Working Group (FPTWG), road/rail tenure holders and other stakeholders/partners to prioritize, plan and fund the restoration of fish passage at road crossing structure barriers within the Parsnip River, Carp River and Crooked River watershed groups. This project builds on Society for Ecosystem Restoration Northern BC (SERNbc) work in: Parsnip River Watershed – Fish Habitat Confirmations (PEA-F20-F-2967) (Irvine 2020) PEA-F22-F-3577-DCA Restoring Fish Passage in the Peace Region (Irvine 2022) Restoring Fish Passage in the Peace Region - 2022 - PEA-F23-F-3761-DCA (Irvine and Winterscheidt 2023) Restoring Fish Passage in the Peace Region - 2023 (Irvine and Winterscheidt 2024) Through this year’s project activities (2024/2025) we engaged numerous project partners and were able to identify, complete and catalyze fish passage restoration activities at multiple priority sites. Through the ongoing development of open source analysis, data presentation and project collaboration tools we are identifying new restoration opportunities, clarifying restoration benefits, communicating with the broader community and implementing on the ground works.

"],["background.html", "2 Background 2.1 Tse’khene 2.2 Fisheries", " 2 Background The study area includes the FWCP Peace Region with a focus to date on traditional territories of the Tse’khene First Nations. In 2024, field assessments were completed with the Parsnip River, Carp River and Crooked River watershed groups (Figure 2.1). In 2019/2020, following a literature review, analysis of fish habitat modelling data, the Provincial Stream Crossing Inventory System (PSCIS) and a community scoping exercise within the McLeod Lake Indian Band habitat confirmation assessments were conducted at 17 sites throughout the Parsnip River watershed with 10 crossings rated as high priorities for rehabilitation and three crossings rated as moderate priorities for restoration. An engineering design for site 125179 on a tributary to the Missinka River was also completed through the 2019/2020 project. In 2021/2022, project activities reconvened through FWCP directed project PEA-F22-F-3577-DCA. Partners were engaged, funding was raised, planning was conducted and reporting was completed to initiate restoration activities of high priority crossings. Materials were purchased and permitting was put in place to prep for replacement of the twin culverts on the Missinka River tributary with a clear-span bridge. In 2024/2025, this collaborative project leveraged ongoing connectivity restoration initiatives in the province and engaged multiple partners to catalyze fish passage restoration activities at high-priority sites identified in from 2019-2023. Key accomplishments include the replacement of PSCIS crossing 125231 on a tributary to the Table River and field assessments including effectiveness monitoring at PSCIS crossing 125179 which was replaced in 2022. knitr::include_graphics(&quot;fig/fishpassage_2024_fwcp_progress.jpeg&quot;) Figure 2.1: Overview map of Study Area 2.1 Tse’khene The Parsnip River watershed is located within the south-eastern portion of the 108,000 km2 traditional territory of the Tse’khene from the McLeod Lake Indian Band. The Tse’khene “People of the Rocks” are a south westerly extension of the Athabascan speaking people of northern Canada. They were nomadic hunters whose language belongs to the Beaver-Sarcee-Tse’khene branch of Athapaskan (“History Who We Are” 2023). Extensive work is underway to preserve the language with resources such as First Voices available online and in app form for iphone and ipad devices. The continental divide separates watersheds flowing north into the Arctic Ocean via the Mackenzie River and south and west into the Pacific Ocean via the Fraser River (Figure 2.1). The Parsnip River is a 6th order stream with a watershed that drains an area of 5597km2. The mainstem of the river flows within the Rocky Mountain Trench in a north direction into Williston Reservoir starting from the continental divide adjacent to Arctic Lakes. Major tributaries include the Misinchinka, Colbourne, Reynolds, Anzac, Table, Hominka and Missinka sub-basins which drain the western slopes of the Hart Ranges of the Rocky Mountains. The Parsnip River has a mean annual discharge of 150 m3/s with flow patterns typical of high elevation watersheds on the west side of the northern Rocky Mountains which receive large amounts of precipitation as snow leading to peak levels of discharge during snowmelt, typically from May to July (Figure 2.2). Construction of the 183m high and 2134m long W.A.C. Bennett Dam was completed in 1967 at Hudson’s Hope, BC, creating the Williston Reservoir (Hirst 1991). Filling of the 375km2 reservoir was complete in 1972 and flooded a substantial portion of the Parsnip River and major tributary valleys forming what is now known as the Peace and Parsnip reaches. The replacement of riverine habitat with an inundated reservoir environment resulted in profound changes to the ecology, resource use and human settlement patterns in these systems (Hagen et al. 2015a; Pearce et al. 2019; Stamford, Hagen, and Williamson 2017). Prior to the filling of the reservoir, the Pack River, into which McLeod Lake flows, was a major tributary to the Parsnip River. The Pack River currently enters the Williston Reservoir directly as the historic location of the confluence of the two rivers lies within the reservoir’s footprint. # knitr::include_graphics(&quot;fig/hydrology1-1.png&quot;) ##left this here in case we want to go back to having this build from scratch. # img &lt;- png::readPNG(&quot;fig/hydrology1.png&quot;) # grid::grid.raster(img) knitr::include_graphics(&quot;fig/hydrograph_07EE007.png&quot;) Figure 2.2: Parsnip River Above Misinchinka River (Station #07EE007 - Lat 55.08194 Lon -122.913063).

In addition to flooding related to the formation of the Williston Reservoir, transmission lines, gas pipelines, rail, road networks, forestry, elevated water temperatures, interrupted connectivity, invasion from non-native species and insect infestations affecting forested areas pose threats to fisheries values in the Parsnip River watershed (Hagen et al. 2015b; Stamford, Hagen, and Williamson 2017; Hagen and Weber 2019a; Comittee on the Status of Endangered Wildlife in Canada 2012). A brief summary of trends and knowledge status related to Arctic grayling, bull trout, kokanee, mountain whitefish and rainbow trout in Williston Watershed streams is provided in Fish and Wildlife Compensation Program (2020) with a more detailed review of the state of knowledge for Parsnip River watershed populations of Arctic grayling and bull trout provided below. fiss_species_table &lt;- readr::read_csv(paste0(getwd(), &#39;/data/inputs_extracted/fiss_species_table.csv&#39;)) fiss_species_table %&gt;% fpr::fpr_kable(caption_text = &#39;Fish species recorded in the Parsnip River, Carp Lake, and Crooked River watershed groups.&#39;, footnote_text = &#39;COSEWIC abbreviations : SC - Special concern DD - Data deficient NAR - Not at risk BC List definitions : Yellow - Species that is apparently secure Blue - Species that is of special concern Exotic - Species that have been moved beyond their natural range as a result of human activity &#39;, scroll = gitbook_on) Table 2.1: Fish species recorded in the Parsnip River, Carp Lake, and Crooked River watershed groups.

Bull Trout populations of the Williston Reservoir watershed are included within the Western Arctic population ‘Designatable Unit 10’, which, in 2012, received a ranking of ‘Special Concern’ by the Committee on the Status of Endangered Wildlife in Canada (COSEWIC 2012). They were added to Schedule 1 under the Species of Risk Act in 2019 (Species Registry Canada 2020) and are also considered of special concern (blue-listed) provincially (BC Species &amp; Ecosystem Explorer 2020). Some or all of the long-term foot survey index sections of four Williston Reservoir spawning tributaries (Davis Creek, Misinchinka River, Point Creek, and Scott Creek), have been surveyed within 16 of the 19 years between 2001 and 2019 (16 of 19 in Davis River, 10 years over a 13-year period in the Misinchinka River, 11 years over a 14-year period for Point Creek, and 9 years over an 11-year period for Scott Creek (Hagen, Spendlow, and Pillipow 2020). A study of sa’ba critical habitats in the Parsnip River was conducted in 2014 with the Misinchinka and Anzac systems identified as the most important systems for adfluvial (large bodied) bull trout spawners. The Table River was also highlighted as an important spawning destination. Other watersheds identified as containing runs of large bodied bull troutspawners included the Colbourne, Reynolds, Hominka and Missinka River with potentially less than 50 spawners utilizing each sub-basin (Hagen et al. 2015a). Hagen and Weber (2019b) have synthesized a large body of information regarding limiting factors, enhancement potential, critical habitats and conservation status for bull trout of the Williston Reservoir and the reader is encouraged to review this work for context. They have recommended experimental enhancements within a monitoring framework for Williston Reservoir bull trout (some spawning and rearing in Parsnip River mainstem and tributaries) which include stream fertilization, side channel development, riparian restoration and fish access improvement. In 2018, sub-basins of the Anzac River watershed, Homininka River, Missinka River and Table River watersheds were designated as fisheries sensitive watersheds under the authority of the Forest and Range Practices Act due to significant downstream fisheries values and significant watershed sensitivity (Beaudry 2013a, 2014a, 2014b, 2013c). Special management is required in these watersheds to protect habitat for fish species including bull trout and Arctic grayling including measures (among others) to limit equivalent clearcut area, reduce impacts to natural stream channel morphology, retain old growth attributes and maintain fish habitat/movement (Forest and Range Practices Act 2018). Arctic Grayling - dusk’ihje Tse’khene Elders from the McLeod Lake Indian Band report that Arctic grayling numbers have declined dramatically since the flooding of the reservoir and that few dusk’ihje (Arctic Grayling) have been caught in the territory in the past 30 years (Pearce et al. 2019). Since impoundment of the Williston Reservoir, it appears that physical habitat and ecological changes have been the most significant factors limiting Arctic grayling productivity. Although these changes are not well understood they have likely resulted in the inundation of key low gradient juvenile rearing and overwintering habitats, isolation of previously connected populations and increases in abundance of predators such as bull trout (Shrimpton, Roberts, and Clarke 2012; Hagen, Pillipow, and Gantner 2018). Rapid increases in industrial activity and angler access in the Parsnip River watershed pose significant risks to Arctic Grayling productivity with these threats primarily linked to forestry and pipeline initiatives (Hagen and Stamford 2021). A detailed review of dusk’ihje life history can be referenced in Stamford, Hagen, and Williamson (2017). Migration of mature adult dusk’ihje (Arctic grayling) occurs in the spring with arrival at known spawning locations coinciding with water temperatures of 4\\(^\\circ\\)C. Spawning in the Parsnip watershed appears to occur between late-May and late-June within sites located primarily within the lower reaches of the Anzac and Table rivers as well as within the Parsnip River mainstem. Side-channel and multiple-channel locations containing small gravels appear to be selected for spawning. Currently, the primary distribution of Williston Arctic grayling appears to be among fourth order and larger streams (Williamson and Zimmerman 2005; Stamford, Hagen, and Williamson 2017). Stewart et al. (2007) report that Arctic grayling spawn in large and small tributaries to rivers and lakes, intermittent streams, within mainstem rivers as well as lakes, most commonly at tributary mouths. Although past study results indicate that 0+ grayling appeared to overwinter in lower reaches of larger tributaries (i.e. Table, Anzac rivers) as well as the Parsnip River and that few age-1+ grayling have been sampled in tributaries, habitat use in small tributaries and the extent they are connected with the mainstem habitats of all core areas is not well understood. Between 1995 and 2019, Arctic grayling population monitoring has been conducted in the Table River in nine out of 25 years (8 years for the Anzac) using snorkel surveys. Results from 2018 and 2019 are intended to contribute to the assessment of the conservation status of the species in the Parsnip Core area (Hagen, Pillipow, and Gantner 2018). In 2019, preliminary telemetry results indicate that both Arctic grayling and bull trout rely on the Parsnip River mainstem for overwinter residencies. Arctic grayling move into the tributaries beginning in April, and become widespread across the watershed by June. A 5 year study on Parsnip River watershed dusk’ihje abundance and trend are discussed in Hagen and Stamford (2023) where they report that the most productive habitats for Arctic grayling summer rearing are within the Anzac River and Table River. Although estimated abundance is lower than in the Anzac and Table, productive summer rearing habitats for adult Arctic grayling in the upper Parsnip River watershed are distributed between 36-25 km of the Missinka River and from 48-32 km of the Hominka River. Hagen and Stamford (2021) report that within the Anzac River, a 30-km stretch from a chute obstruction at 47 km to 16 km is assumed to provide productive summer rearing habitats for adults as it is characterized by a high abundance of Arctic grayling. Although the spatial distribution of high Arctic grayling abundance in the Table River has not been determined through reconnaissance surveys it has been observed to span at least a 20-km zone from the waterfall migration barrier at 37 km to 18 km. Spatial ecology studies in the Parsnip between 2018 and 2021 has been reported on by Martins et al. (2022) with results related to: temperature modeling and spatio-temporal patterns in thermal habitat, telemetry data modeling and arctic grayling spatial ecology, and trophic relationships between Arctic grayling and bull trout A review of available fisheries data for the Parsnip River watershed stratified by different habitat characteristics can provide insight into which habitats may provide the highest intrinsic value for fish species based on the number of fish captured in those habitats in past assessment work (Figures 2.3 - 2.5). It should be noted however that it should not be assumed that all habitat types have been sampled in a non-biased fashion or that particular sites selected do not have a disproportionate influence on the overall dataset composition (ie. fish salvage sites are often located adjacent to construction sites which are more commonly located near lower gradient stream reaches). # fiss_sum &lt;- readr::read_csv(file = paste0(getwd(), &#39;/data/extracted_inputs/fiss_sum.csv&#39;)) fiss_sum_grad &lt;- readr::read_csv(file = paste0(getwd(), &#39;/data/inputs_extracted/fiss_sum_grad.csv&#39;)) fiss_sum_width &lt;- readr::read_csv(file = paste0(getwd(), &#39;/data/inputs_extracted/fiss_sum_width.csv&#39;)) fiss_sum_wshed &lt;- readr::read_csv(file = paste0(getwd(), &#39;/data/inputs_extracted/fiss_sum_wshed.csv&#39;)) # A summary of historical westslope cutthrout trout observations in the Elk River watershed group by average gradient category of associated stream segment is provided in Figure \\@ref(fig:fish-wct-bar).

Engagement actions have included video conference calls, meetings, emails, presentations and phone calls. 3.1.2 Collaborative GIS Environment Geographical Information Systems are essential for developing and communicating restoration plans as well as the reasons they are required and how they are developed. Without the ability to visualize the landscape and the data that is used to make decisions, it is difficult to conduct and communicate the need for restoration, the details of past and future plans as well as and the potential results of physical works. To facilitate the planning and implementation of restoration activities, a collaborative GIS environment has been established using QGIS and is served on the cloud using source code stored here. This environment is intended to be a space where project team members can access, view, and contribute to the amalgamation of background spatial data and the development of restoration as well as monitoring for the project. The collaborative GIS environment allows users to view, edit, and analyze shared, up to date spatial data on personal computers in an office setting as well as on phones and tablets in the field. At the time of reporting, the environment was being used to develop and share maps, conduct spatial analyses, communicate restoration plans to stakeholders as well as to provide a central place to store methodologies and tools for conducting field assessments on standardized pre-developed digital forms. The platform can also be used to track the progress of restoration activities and monitor changes in the landscape over time, helping encourage the record keeping of past and future restoration activities in a coordinated manner. The shared QGIS project was created using scripts currently kept in dff-2022 with the precise calls to project creation scripts tracked in the project_creation_and_permissions.txt document kept in the main QGIS project directory. Information about the scripts used for GIS project creation and updates can be viewed here with outcomes of their use summarized below: Download and clip user specified layers from the BC Data Catalogue as well as data layers stored in custom Amazon Web Services buckets for an area of interest defined by a list of watershed groups and load to a geopackage called background_layers.gpkg stored in the main directory of the project. A project directory is created to hold the spatial data and QGIS project information (ie. layer symbology and naming conventions, metadata, etc.). Metadata for individual project spatial layers is kept in the rfp_tracking table within the background_layers.gpkg along with tables related to user supplied stream width/gradient inputs to bcfishpass to model potentially high value habitat that is accessible to fish species of interest. 3.1.3 Issue Tracking “Issues” logged on the online github platform are effective ways to track tasks, enhancements, and bugs related to project components. They can be referenced with the scripts, text and actions used to address them by linking documentation to the issues with text comments or programatically through git commit messages. Issues for this project are kept here. 3.1.4 Mapping The workflows to produce the georeferenced pdf maps include using a QGIS layer file defining and symbolizing all layers required and are continuously evolving. At the time of reporting - mapping scripts and associated layer file were kept under version control within bcfishpass here. Loading the QGIS layer file within a QGIS project, allows load and representation of all map component layers provided the user points to a postgresql database populated via bcfishpass outputs. 3.2 Planning 3.2.1 Habitat Modelling Habitat modelling used to help guide planning for field assessments is generated by bcfishpass (Norris [2020] 2024) which has been designed to prioritize potential fish passage barriers for assessment or remediation by generating a simple model of aquatic habitat connectivity. We utilize the bcfishpass access model and linear spawning/rearing habitat model for planning purposes. These models provide a valuable starting point, but their results are not definitive and should always be considered with professional judgment. Detailed information regarding model parameters and limitations can be found at the following links: bcfishpass background information Access model Linear spawning/rearing habitat model The access model identifies natural barriers (ex. steep gradients for extended distances) and hydroelectric dams to classify the accessibility of streams for fish (Norris [2020] 2021). On potentially accessible streams, scripts identify known barriers (ex. waterfalls &gt;5m high) and additional anthropogenic features which are primarily road/railway stream crossings (i.e. culverts) that are potentially barriers. To prioritize these features for assessment or remediation, scripts report on how much modelled potentially accessible aquatic habitat the barriers may obstruct. The model can be refined with numerous parameters including known fish observations upstream of identified barriers and for each crossing location, the area of lake and wetland habitat upstream, species documented upstream/downstream, and an estimate of watershed area (on 2nd order and higher streams). Furthermore, mean annual precipitation weighted to upstream watershed area, stream discharge, and channel width can be collated using bcfishpass, fwapg and bcfishobs. This information can be used to provide an indication of the potential quantity and quality of habitat potentially gained should fish passage be restored, by comparing to user defined thresholds for the aforementioned parameters. The linear spawning and rearing habitat model uses species-specific thresholds for stream gradient (Table 3.1), channel width or discharge, network connectivity, and habitat type to assess the intrinsic potential of streams to support spawning and rearing. It also incorporates documented spawning locations and literature-derived parameters to refine habitat suitability estimates. This model helps guide field assessments and prioritize locations for fish passage restoration. Regarding gradients, bcfishpass calculates the average gradient of BC Freshwater Atlas stream network lines at minimum 100m long intervals starting from the downstream end of the streamline segment and working upstream. The network lines are broken into max gradient categories with new segments created if and when the average slope of the stream line segment exceeds user provided thresholds. For this phase of the project, the user provided gradient thresholds used to delineate “potentially accessible habitat” were based on estimated max gradients that rainbow trout (20%) and bull trout (25%) are likely to be capable of ascending. Gradient, channel size and stream discharge are key determinants of channel morphology and subsequently fish distribution. High value rearing, overwintering, and spawning habitat preferred by numerous species/life stages of fish are often located within channel types that have relatively low gradients and large channel widths (also quantified by the amount of flow in the stream). Following delineation of “potentially accessible habitat”, the average gradient of each stream segment within habitat classified as below the 20% and 25% thresholds was calculated and summed within species and life stage specific gradient categories. Average gradient of stream line segments can be calculated from elevations contained in the provincial freshwater atlas streamline dataset. To obtain estimates of channel width upstream of crossing locations, where available, bcfishpass was utilized to pull average channel gradients from Fisheries Information Summary System (FISS) site assessment data (MoE 2019b) or PSCIS assessment data (MoE 2021) and associate with stream segment lines. When both FISS and PSCIS values were associated with a particular stream segment, or multiple FISS channel widths are available a mean of the average channel widths was used. To model channel width for 2nd order and above stream segments without associated FISS or PSCIS sites, first fwapg was used to estimate the drainage area upstream of the segment. Then, rasters from ClimateBC (Wang et al. 2012) were downloaded to a postgresql database, sampled for upstream watershed areas associated with each stream segment and a mean annual precipitation weighted by upstream watershed area was calculated. In early 2021, Bayesian statistical methods were developed to predict channel width in all provincial freshwater atlas stream segments where width measurements had not previously been measured in the field. The model was based on the relationship between watershed area and mean annual precipitation weighted by upstream watershed area (Thorley and Irvine 2021). In December of 2021, Thorley and Irvine (2021) methods were updated using a power model derived by Finnegan et al. (2005) which relates stream discharge to watershed area and mean annual precipitation. Data (n = 24849) on watershed size, mean annual precipitation and measured channel width was extracted from the provincial freshwater atlas (FLNRORD 2021; GeoBC 2022), the BC Data Catalogue fisheries datasets (MoE 2024b, 2021) and Wang et al. (2012) utilizing bcfishpass (Norris [2020] 2021) and fwapg (Norris [2019] 2021). Details of this analysis and subsequent outputs can be reviewed in Attachment 3 (Thorley, Norris, and Irvine 2021). bcfishpass and associated tools have been designed to be flexible in analysis, accepting user defined gradient, channel width and stream discharge categories (MoE 2019b). Although currently in draft form, and subject to development revisions, gradient and channel width thresholds for habitat with the highest intrinsic value for a number of fish species in the Parsnip River watershed group have been specified and applied to model habitat upstream of stream crossing locations with the highest potential intrinsic value (Table 3.1). Definitions of modelling outputs for bull trout are presented in Table 3.2. Modelling of habitat for Arctic grayling in the Peace region are planned for 2024-2025 with the work leveraging multiple other initiatives underway by SERNbc and others throughout British Columbia including work related to Arctic grayling habitat use and preference conducted by UNBC and others (Hagen and Stamford 2023; Bottoms et al. 2023). #`r if(identical(gitbook_on, FALSE)){knitr::asis_output(&quot;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&quot;)}` species &lt;- c(&#39;BT&#39;,&#39;GR&#39;) text_footnote &lt;- &quot;&quot; #&quot;Models for RB, GR and KO are under a process of development and have not yet been released.

The reader is referred to (MoE 2011) for detailed methodology. Crossings surveyed included closed bottom structures (CBS), open bottom structures (OBS) and crossings considered “other” (i.e. fords). Photos were taken at surveyed crossings and when possible included images of the road, crossing inlet, crossing outlet, crossing barrel, channel downstream and channel upstream of the crossing and any other relevant features. The following information was recorded for all surveyed crossings: date of inspection, crossing reference, crew member initials, Universal Transverse Mercator (UTM) coordinates, stream name, road name and kilometer, road tenure information, crossing type, crossing subtype, culvert diameter or span for OBS, culvert length or width for OBS. A more detailed “full assessment” was completed for all closed bottom structures and included the following parameters: presence/absence of continuous culvert embedment (yes/no), average depth of embedment, whether or not the culvert bed resembled the native stream bed, presence of and percentage backwatering, road fill depth, outlet drop, outlet pool depth, inlet drop, culvert slope, average downstream channel width, stream slope, presence/absence of beaver activity, presence/absence of fish at time of survey, type of valley fill, and a habitat value rating. Habitat value ratings were based on channel morphology, flow characteristics (perennial, intermittent, ephemeral), fish migration patterns, the presence/absence of deep pools, un-embedded boulders, substrate, woody debris, undercut banks, aquatic vegetation and overhanging riparian vegetation (Table 3.4). fpr_table_habvalue |&gt; knitr::kable(caption = &#39;Habitat value criteria (Fish Passage Technical Working Group, 2011).&#39;, booktabs = T, label = NA) |&gt; kableExtra::column_spec(column = 1, width_min = &#39;1.5in&#39;) |&gt; kableExtra::kable_styling(c(&quot;condensed&quot;), full_width = T, font_size = font_set) Table 3.4: Habitat value criteria (Fish Passage Technical Working Group, 2011). Habitat Value Fish Habitat Criteria High The presence of high value spawning or rearing habitat (e.g., locations with abundance of suitably sized gravels, deep pools, undercut banks, or stable debris) which are critical to the fish population. Medium Important migration corridor. Presence of suitable spawning habitat. Habitat with moderate rearing potential for the fish species present. Low No suitable spawning habitat, and habitat with low rearing potential (e.g., locations without deep pools, undercut banks, or stable debris, and with little or no suitably sized spawning gravels for the fish species present). Fish passage potential was determined for each stream crossing identified as a closed bottom structure as per MoE (2011). The combined scores from five criteria: depth and degree to which the structure is embedded, outlet drop, stream width ratio, culvert slope, and culvert length were used to screen whether each culvert was a likely barrier to some fish species and life stages (Table 3.5, Table 3.6). These criteria were developed based on data obtained from various studies and reflect an estimation for the passage of a juvenile salmon or small resident rainbow trout (Clarkin et al. 2005; Bell 1991; Thompson 2013). For crossings determined to be potential barriers or barriers based on the data, a culvert fix and recommended diameter/span was proposed. tab &lt;- as_tibble(t(fpr_table_barrier_scoring)) |&gt; mutate(V4 = names(fpr_table_barrier_scoring)) |&gt; select(V4, everything()) |&gt; janitor::row_to_names(1) |&gt; ##turn the table sideways mutate(Risk = case_when(Risk == &#39;Value&#39; ~ &#39; Value&#39;, T ~ Risk)) tab |&gt; fpr::fpr_kable(caption_text = &#39;Fish Barrier Risk Assessment (MoE 2011).&#39;, scroll = F) Table 3.5: Fish Barrier Risk Assessment (MoE 2011).

Cumlative Score Result 0-14 passable 15-19 potential barrier &gt;20 barrier Habitat gain indexes are the quantity of modelled habitat upstream of the subject crossing and represents an estimate of habitat gained with remediation of fish passage at the crossing. For this project, a gradient threshold between accessible and non-accessible habitat was set at 25% (for a minimimum length of 100m) and intended to represent the maximum gradient of which the strongest swimmers of anadromous species (bull trout) are likely to be able to migrate upstream. This is the amount of habitat upstream of each crossing less than 25% gradient before a falls of height &gt;5m - as recorded in MoE (2020) or documented in other bcfishpass online documentation. For Phase 2 - habitat confirmation sites, conservative estimates of the linear quantity of habitat to be potentially gained by fish passage restoration, bull trout rearing maximum gradient threshold (10.5%) was used. To generate estimates for area of habitat upstream (m2), the estimated linear length was multiplied by half the downstream channel width measured (overall triangular channel shape) as part of the fish passage assessment protocol. Although these estimates are not generally conservative, have low accuracy and do not account for upstream stream crossing structures they allow a rough idea of the best candidates for follow up. Potential options to remediate fish passage were selected from MoE (2011) and included: Removal (RM) - Complete removal of the structure and deactivation of the road. Open Bottom Structure (OBS) - Replacement of the culvert with a bridge or other open bottom structure. Based on consultation with FLNR road crossing engineering experts, for this project we considered bridges as the only viable option for OBS type . Streambed Simulation (SS) - Replacement of the structure with a streambed simulation design culvert. Often achieved by embedding the culvert by 40% or more. Based on consultation with FLNR engineering experts, we considered crossings on streams with a channel width of &lt;2m and a stream gradient of &lt;8% as candidates for replacement with streambed simulations. Additional Substrate Material (EM) - Add additional substrate to the culvert and/or downstream weir to embed culvert and reduce overall velocity/turbulence. This option was considered only when outlet drop = 0, culvert slope &lt;1.0% and stream width ratio &lt; 1.0. Backwater (BW) - Backwatering of the structure to reduce velocity and turbulence. This option was considered only when outlet drop &lt; 0.3m, culvert slope &lt;2.0%, stream width ratio &lt; 1.2 and stream profiling indicates it would be effective.. 3.3.1 Cost Estimates Cost estimates for structure replacement with bridges and embedded culverts were generated based on the channel width, slope of the culvert, depth of fill, road class and road surface type. Road details were sourced from FLNRORD (2020b) and FLNRORD (2020a) through bcfishpass. Interviews with Phil MacDonald, Engineering Specialist FLNR - Kootenay, Steve Page, Area Engineer - FLNR - Northern Engineering Group and Matt Hawkins - MoTi - Design Supervisor for Highway Design and Survey - Nelson were utilized to help refine estimates which have since been adjusted for inflation in 2020 and based on past experience. Base costs for installation of bridges on forest service roads and permit roads with surfaces specified in provincial GIS road layers as rough and loose was estimated at $30000/linear m and assumed that the road could be closed during construction and a minimum bridge span of 15m. For streams with channel widths &lt;2m, embedded culverts were reported as an effective solution with total installation costs estimated at $100k/crossing (pers. comm. Phil MacDonald, Steve Page then adjusted for inflation in 2020). For larger streams (&gt;6m), estimated span width increased proportionally to the size of the stream. For crossings with large amounts of fill (&gt;3m), the replacement bridge span was increased by an additional 3m for each 1m of fill &gt;3m to account for cutslopes to the stream at a 1.5:1 ratio. To account for road type, a multiplier table was generated to estimate incremental cost increases with costs estimated for structure replacement on paved surfaces, railways and arterial/highways costing up to 15 times more than forest service roads due to expenses associate with design/engineering requirements, traffic control and paving. The cost multiplier table (Table 3.7) should be considered very approximate with refinement recommended for future projects. sfpr_xref_road_cost() |&gt; mutate(cost_m_1000s_bridge = formatC(cost_m_1000s_bridge * 15000, format=&quot;d&quot;, big.mark=&quot;,&quot;)) |&gt; mutate(cost_embed_cv = formatC(cost_embed_cv * 1000, format=&quot;d&quot;, big.mark=&quot;,&quot;)) |&gt; rename( Class = my_road_class, Surface = my_road_surface, `Class Multiplier` = road_class_mult, `Surface Multiplier` = road_surface_mult, `Bridge $/15m` = cost_m_1000s_bridge, `Streambed Simulation $` = cost_embed_cv ) |&gt; dplyr::filter(!is.na(Class)) |&gt; mutate(Class =case_when( Class == &#39;fsr&#39; ~ str_to_upper(Class), TRUE ~ stringr::str_to_title(Class)), Surface = stringr::str_to_title(Surface) ) |&gt; # dplyr::filter(Class != &#39;FSR&#39; &amp; Surface != &#39;Paved&#39;) |&gt; fpr::fpr_kable(caption_text = &#39;Cost multiplier table based on road class and surface type.&#39;, scroll = F) Table 3.7: Cost multiplier table based on road class and surface type.

Completed designs are loaded to the PSCIS data portal. 3.5 Habitat Confirmation Assessments Following fish passage assessments, habitat confirmations were completed in accordance with procedures outlined in the document “A Checklist for Fish Habitat Confirmation Prior to the Rehabilitation of a Stream Crossing” (Fish Passage Technical Working Group 2011). The main objective of the field surveys was to document upstream habitat quantity and quality and to determine if any other obstructions exist above or below the crossing. Habitat value was assessed based on channel morphology, flow characteristics (perennial, intermittent, ephemeral), the presence/absence of deep pools, un-embedded boulders, substrate, woody debris, undercut banks, aquatic vegetation and overhanging riparian vegetation. Criteria used to rank habitat value was based on guidelines in Fish Passage Technical Working Group (2011) (Table 3.4). During habitat confirmations, to standardize data collected and facilitate submission of the data to provincial databases, information was collected on “Site Cards”. Habitat characteristics recorded included channel widths, wetted widths, residual pool depths, gradients, bankfull depths, stage, temperature, conductivity, pH, cover by type, substrate and channel morphology (among others). When possible, the crew surveyed downstream of the crossing to a minimum distance 300m and upstream to a minimum distance of 500 - 600m. Any potential obstacles to fish passage were inventoried with photos, physical descriptions and locations recorded on site cards. Surveyed routes were recorded with time-signatures on handheld GPS units. 3.6 Fish Sampling 3.6.1 Electrofishing Fish sampling was conducted on a subset of sites when biological data was considered to add significant value to the physical habitat assessment information. Electrofishing was utilized for fish sampling according to stream inventory standards and procedures found in the Reconnaissance (1:20 000) Fish and Fish Habitat Inventory Manual (Resources Inventory Committee 2001). A Haltech 2000 backpack electrofisher was used within discrete site units both upstream and downstream of the subject crossing with electrofisher settings and seconds, water quality parameters (i.e. conductivity, temperature and ph), start and end locations, length of site and wetted widths (average of a minimum of three) recorded. 3.6.2 Fish Handling and Processing Captured fish were held in buckets with sufficient water to minimize stress until processing, and multiple buckets were used when catch numbers were high. For each fish captured, fork length, weight and species was recorded with results documented in the fish data submission spreadsheet. 3.6.3 Pit Tagging Fish with a fork length greater than 60 mm and belonging to species approved under the scientific fish collection permit PG24-879256 were tagged with Passive Integrated Transponders (PIT tags) using the Abdominal Cavity method outlined by Biomark. To anesthetize fish prior to pit tagging, we used a solution of approximately 0.1 mL of clove oil per 1 L of water (1:10,000). This concentration was selected for its efficiency in providing effective sedation with minimal residual effects, making it ideal for studies in which fish are released back into their natural habitats (Fernandes et al. 2017). The clove oil solution was prepared in advance by dissolving pure clove oil in ethyl alcohol in a 1:9 ratio (clove oil: ethyl alcohol) to enhance solubility, then mixed into the water bucket (Fernandes et al. 2017). Fish were immersed in this solution until they reached an appropriate level of anesthesia for handling and then were tagged. To maintain needle sharpness and minimize injury risk, needles were replaced approximately every 10 fish. Each tagged fish was scanned with the PIT reader, and both the PIT tag ID and row ID were recorded. Once tagged, fish were placed into a bucket of fresh water and allowed to recover before being released back into the stream. Fish information and habitat data will be submitted to the province under scientific fish collection permit PG24-879256. 3.7 Remediations Structure replacement was conducted by contractors hired by Sinclar (forest licensee). As-built drawings were completed and loaded to the PSCIS data portal. 3.8 Climate Change Risk Assessment In collaboration with the Ministry of Transportation and Infrastructure (MoTi), a new climate change replacement program aims to prioritize vulnerable culverts for replacement (pers. comm Sean Wong, 2022) based on data collected and ranked related to three categories - culvert condition, vulnerability and priority. Within the “condition” risk category - data was collected and crossings were ranked based on erosion, embankment and blockage issues. The “climate” risk category included ranked assessments of the likelihood of both a flood event affecting the culvert as well as the consequence of a flood event affecting the culvert. Within the “priority” category the following factors were ranked - traffic volume, community access, cost, constructability, fish bearing status and environmental impacts (Table 3.8).

Records from the following datasets have been included: The Fisheries Information Summary System (FISS); the Fish Habitat Inventory and Information Program (FHIIP); the Field Data Information System (FDIS) and the Resource Analysis Branch (RAB) inventory studies. The main intent of this layer is to have a single layer of all known obstacles to fish passage. It is important to note that not all waterbodies have been studied and, not all lengths of many waterbodies have been studied so there are a very high number of obstacles in the real world that are not recorded in this dataset. This layer simply reports the obstacles to fish that are known. It is also very important to note that we are acknowledging these features as obstacles to fish passage versus barriers to fish passage. This is because an obstacle may be a barrier at one time of year but not at other times depending on the volume of water present and also, what is a barrier to one species of fish is not necessarily a barrier to another species. whse_fish.fiss_stream_sample_sites_sp https://catalogue.data.gov.bc.ca/dataset/e616864b-8991-42d1-a2f9-4d4402c32be8 This spatial layer displays stream inventory sample sites that have had full or partial surveys, and contains measurements or indicator information of the data collected at each survey site on each date. whse_fish.pscis_assessment_svw https://catalogue.data.gov.bc.ca/dataset/7ecfafa6-5e18-48cd-8d9b-eae5b5ea2881 Points where a fish passage assessment has been performed on a stream crossing structure.

Design points have been identified as a priority for remediation based on a variety of potential criteria: quality of habitat upstream, quantity of fish habitat upstream, number and importance of species present, operational plans for the road cost of the proposed remediation, etc. They are sites where the amount of habitat to be gained by remediation has been confirmed and where a design has actually been completed. whse_fish.pscis_habitat_confirmation_svw https://catalogue.data.gov.bc.ca/dataset/572595ab-0a25-452a-a857-1b6bb9c30495 Points where an evaluation of the fish habitat up and downstream of a road crossing have been carried out. Phase 2 of 4 in the Fish Passage Workflow, Habitat Confirmations are done at sites where the crossing structure is known to be a failure. The Habitat Confirmation is performed to ensure that the site in question is a good candidate for moving on to the Design (Phase 3) and Remediation (Phase 4) stages of the workflow. The Habitat Confirmation confirms the crossing is a barrier, places the crossing in context with respect to other roads and crossings in the watershed and also quantifies and qualifies how much habitat will be gained if the site is fixed. whse_fish.pscis_remediation_svw https://catalogue.data.gov.bc.ca/dataset/1596afbf-f427-4f26-9bca-d78bceddf485 Points where a barrier to fish passage has been rectified or remediated.

Burn severity mapping is conducted using best available pre- and post-fire satellite multispectral imagery acquired by the MultiSpectral Instrument (MSI) aboard the Sentinel-2 satellite or the Operational Land Imager (OLI) sensor aboard the Landsat-8 and 9 satellites. The post-fire imagery is acquired during the subsequent growing season. Mapping conducted during the subsequent growing season benefits from greater post-fire image availability and is expected to be more representative of tree mortality. Every attempt is made to use cloud, smoke, shadow and snow-free imagery that was acquired prior to September 30th. Please note, this layer is 1-year-later burn severity dataset. The same-year burn severity mapping dataset (WHSE_FOREST_VEGETATION.VEG_BURN_SEVERITY_SAME_YR_SP) is considered an interim product to this layer. 4.2.0.1 Methodology: • Select suitable pre- and post-fire imagery or create a cloud/snow/smoke-free composite from multiple images scenes • Calculate normalized burn severity ratio (NBR) for pre- and post-fire images • Calculate difference NBR (dNBR) where dNBR = pre NBR – post NBR • Apply a scaling equation (dNBR_scaled = dNBR*1000 + 275)/5) • Apply BARC thresholds (76, 110, 187) to create a 4-class image (unburned, low severity, medium severity, and high severity) • Apply region-based filters to reduce noise • Confirm burn severity analysis results through visual quality control • Produce a vector dataset and apply Euclidian distance smoothing whse_human_cultural_economic.hist_hist_trails_svw https://catalogue.data.gov.bc.ca/dataset/98c097cf-32bc-40a6-8061-bfe97a295e37 This dataset contains spatial and tabular data on non-archaeological historic trails in B.C.

In the event of a discrepancy in the data, the metes and bounds description will prevail. Although the boundaries were drawn based on the legal metes and bounds descriptions, they may differ from how regional districts and their member municipalities and electoral areas currently view and/or manage their boundaries. Where discrepancies are noted, the Ministry of Municipal Affairs (the custodian) enters into discussion with the local governments whose boundaries are affected. In order to effect a change to the boundary, Cabinet approval is required. This is done through an Order in Council (OIC). While discrepancies to administrative boundaries are being resolved, boundaries may be adjusted on an ongoing basis until the requested changes are completed. The OIC_YEAR and OIC_NUMBER fields indicate the year that the boundary was passed under OIC and its associated number. The AFFECTED_ADMIN_AREA_ABRVN identifies the administrative areas that are affected by the OIC.

A total of 15 Fish Passage Assessments were completed, including 11 Phase 1 assessments and 4 reassessments. In 2024, field efforts prioritized revisiting previously assessed sites for monitoring rather than evaluating new Fish Passage Assessment locations. Of the 15 sites where fish passage assessments were completed, 11 were not yet inventoried in the PSCIS system. This included 8 crossings considered “passable”, 0 crossings considered a “potential” barrier, and 3 crossings were considered “barriers” according to threshold values based on culvert embedment, outlet drop, slope, diameter (relative to channel size) and length (MoE 2011). Reassessments were completed at 4 sites where PSICS data required updating. A summary of crossings assessed, a rough cost estimate for remediation, and a priority ranking for follow-up for Phase 1 sites is presented in Table 4.4. Detailed data with photos are presented in Appendix - Phase 1 Fish Passage Assessment Data and Photos. The “Barrier” and “Potential Barrier” rankings used in this project followed MoE (2011) and represent an assessment of passability for juvenile salmon or small resident rainbow trout under any flow conditions that may occur throughout the year (Clarkin et al. 2005; Bell 1991; Thompson 2013). As noted in Bourne et al. (2011), with a detailed review of different criteria in Kemp and O’Hanley (2010), passability of barriers can be quantified in many different ways. Fish physiology (i.e. species, length, swim speeds) can make defining passability complex but with important implications for evaluating connectivity and prioritizing remediation candidates (Bourne et al. 2011; Shaw et al. 2016; Mahlum et al. 2014; Kemp and O’Hanley 2010). Washington Department of Fish &amp; Wildlife (2009) present criteria for assigning passability scores to culverts that have already been assessed as barriers in coarser level assessments. These passability scores provide additional information to feed into decision making processes related to the prioritization of remediation site candidates and have potential for application in British Columbia. tab_cost_est_phase1 |&gt; select(`PSCIS ID`:`Cost Est ( $K)`) |&gt; fpr::fpr_kable(caption_text = paste0(&quot;Upstream habitat estimates and cost benefit analysis for Phase 1 assessments ranked as a &#39;barrier&#39; or &#39;potential&#39; barrier. &quot;, sp_network_caption), scroll = F) Table 4.4: Upstream habitat estimates and cost benefit analysis for Phase 1 assessments ranked as a ‘barrier’ or ‘potential’ barrier.

All sites with a design for remediation of fish passage can be found in Table 4.2 by filtering using Design = yes. 4.6 Phase 4 - Remediations In 2024, remediation of fish passage was completed at PSCIS crossing 125231, located on Tributary to Table River at kilometer 21 on the Chuchinka-Table FSR. The crossing was replaced with a clear-span bridge by Canfor with environmental oversight and engineering from DWB Consulting Services Ltd. Partial funding for the project was provided by FWCP through coordination from SERNbc. More information regarding the crossing can be found here. All sites where remediation of fish passage has been completed since 2019 can be found in Table 4.2 by filtering using Remediation = yes. 4.7 Monitoring In 2024, baseline or follow up monitoring data was gathered at four sites: Effectiveness monitoring was conducted on a Tributary to Missinka (PSCIS crossing 125179) on Chuchinka-Missinka FSR which was replaced in 2022. Background can be reviewed here with results of the monitoring presented within this report in Tributary to Missinka River - 125179 - Appendix. In the summer of 2024, Tributary to Table crossing (PSCIS crossing 125131) on Chuchinka-Table FSR was replaced, with effectiveness monitoring conducted in the fall. The initial habitat confirmation for the site is docuemented in Irvine (2020) here. Baseline monitoring in 2023 along with the results of 2024 effectiveness monitoring (updated reporting) can be reviewed in here. Baseline fish sampling was conducted at PSCIS crossing 125261 located on Fern Creek near the 2.1km mark of the Chuchinka-Table FSR. Although restoration of this site (in collaboration with Canfor) had been planned for 2025 - remediation has been delayed due to uncertainty regarding forest harvest activities within the greater Table River watershed. Fish sampling activities including PIT tagging were conducted in 2024 to compliment fish data aquired in 2023. Documentation is provided in Irvine and Winterscheidt (2024) here.

The habitat was good and consisted of cobbles, boulders, and woody debris, providing complexity and cover for fish.The stream flows into the inlet from the east but goes subsurface approximately 10 m upstream, with occasional small, shallow pools. The well-defined stream channel suggests it often carries higher flows. A wetland area to the east of the inlet likely contributes flow to the stream. An ~8 m wide area directly in front of the inlet was dry at the time of assessment but showed evidence of flowing water during higher flows.. 13:14:10 Location and Stream Data Crossing Characteristics – Date 2024-09-10 Crossing Sub Type Bridge PSCIS ID 125231 Diameter (m) 12.2 External ID – Length (m) 5 Crew AI LS Embedded – UTM Zone 10 Depth Embedded (m) – Easting 549973 Resemble Channel – Northing 6065136 Backwatered – Stream Tributary to Table River Percent Backwatered – Road Chuchinka-Table FSR Fill Depth (m) – Road Tenure Canfor R09333 UZ6_16 Outlet Drop (m) – Channel Width (m) – Outlet Pool Depth (m) – Stream Slope (%) – Inlet Drop – Beaver Activity No Slope (%) – Habitat Value – Valley Fill – Final score 0 Barrier Result Passable Fix type – Fix Span / Diameter – Photos: PSCIS ID .

The crossing is located approximately 660m east of PSCIS crossing 125180 and joins this adjacent stream just before emptying into the Missinka River, approximately 1km downstream. At the crossing location, the road is the responsibility of Sinclar Forest Group R01821 51A. The crossing is within the Parsnip River watershed group. Background At the crossing location, Tributary to Missinka River is a second order stream and drains a watershed of approximately 4.3km2. The watershed ranges in elevation from a maximum of 1876m to 799m near the crossing (Table 4.11). In 2018, the Missinka River watershed was designated as a fisheries sensitive watershed under the authority of the Forest and Range Practices Act due to significant downstream fisheries values and watershed sensitivity (Beaudry 2013b). Special management is required in the crossing’s watershed to protect habitat for bull trout and arctic grayling and includes measures (among others) to limit equivalent clearcut area, reduce impacts to natural stream channel morphology, retain old growth attributes and maintain fish habitat/movement. The site was originally prioritized for replacement in 2019 by Irvine (2020), following a habitat confirmation assessment which can be found here. In the summer of 2022, Sinclar Forest Group replaced the crossing with a 15m steel girder permanent bridge with modular timber decks (Irvine and Winterscheidt 2023). In addition to Irvine (2020) - post-replacement documentation regarding this crossing can also be found in the 2022 report here.

In general - the structure appeared stable with no maintenance required at the time of reporting. Lessons learned from the work - to be leveraged towards future projects - include reducing the amount of riprap material placed within the bankfull channel width and replanting of areas where riparian vegetation is removed during construction.

Electrofishing was performed upstream and downstream, with all fish &gt;60mm tagged. See camera roll for additional photos. Recommend bringing old photos as a reference to recreate photo angles and shutter length. Dewatering Notes No dewatering Velocity Notes Velocity was higher under the bridge than both upstream and downstream due to channel constriction from riprap. Constriction Notes Channel width measurements beneath the structure within the road right-of-way were 2.9m, 3.5m, and 2.5m, which were narrower than the typical channel width observed both upstream and downstream, as noted on the fish site cards. Substrate Notes A significant amount of riprap material was present within the channel in the road right-of-way. Occasional pieces of riprap were functioning to create step-pool habitat downstream. Overall, the substrate under the structure was slightly larger than that observed both upstream and downstream. Riparian Notes There did not appear to have been any riparian planting conducted during construction, with only herbaceous regrowth observed, including grasses and fireweed. The site could have been planted with willow whips to provide cover and food. Flow Depth Notes Flow depth was comparable to sections downstream, with measured depths ranging from 5–20cm. At the observed flow levels during the survey, migration was not likely hindered. Stability Notes The structure and extensive rock riprap appeared fully stable, with no evidence of slumping or instability. Revegetation Notes As noted in the riparian section, the construction footprint was vegetated primarily with herbaceous plants where rock was not present. Cover Notes Due to the extensive rock placement within the construction footprint, there was no overhanging vegetation cover. However, occasional pieces of riprap and boulder lines within the channel provided some boulder and step-pool habitat. The larger substrate was providing fish habitat, as observed during electrofishing. Maintenance Notes It appears that no maintenance is required at this time. Fish Sampling As per recommendations in Irvine (2020) and Irvine and Winterscheidt (2023) - to provide reference site data for comparison, electrofishing was conducted not only at the site of the remediation - but also at PSCIS crossing 125180, a similarly sized culverted stream - located approximately 660m east of the subject crossing (Irvine and Winterscheidt 2023; Irvine 2020). Another site (PSCIS crossing 125186) was also scoped for potential as as reference site - however the stream was almost completely dry in 2024 (with the exception of the outlet pool and intermittent shallow pool sections). Upstream on the reference site (125180_us_ef1) - fish lengths and weights were recorded, and all fish with a fork length greater than 60mm were tagged with Passive Integrated Transponders (PIT tags - data stored here. On the first sampling event downstream (125180_ds_ef1) - only species and length data was collected. However, the same site was revisited a few days later (125180_ds_ef2) with length/weight collected and PIT tagging conducted. Results are summarised in Tables 4.13 - 4.14 and Figure 4.5. # species captured downstream tab_fish_summary |&gt; dplyr::filter(site_id == paste0(my_site, &#39;_ds&#39;)) |&gt; dplyr::group_by(site_id) |&gt; dplyr::distinct(species) |&gt; dplyr::pull(species) # species captured upstream tab_fish_summary |&gt; dplyr::filter(site_id == paste0(my_site, &#39;_us&#39;)) |&gt; dplyr::group_by(site_id) |&gt; dplyr::distinct(species) |&gt; dplyr::pull(species) A total of 15 rainbow trout were captured downstream and 12 rainbow trout were captured upstream of crossing 125179 (Figures 4.8 - 4.9). A total of 44 rainbow trout were captured downstream during the first sampling event (125180_ds_ef1), and 24 rainbow trout were captured upstream (Figures 4.10 - 4.11). During the second downstream sampling event (when PIT tagging was conducted - 125180_ds_ef2), a total of 28 rainbow trout were captured. The lower density of rainbow trout parr captured on the second round of sampling within the same section of stream is not surprising since disturbance of the site and handling of fish a few days earlier likely impacted the recapture rate. Conclusion Fish passage at crossing 125179 was restored in the summer of 2022 with a 15m steel girder permanent bridge with modular timber decks. Partial funding for the project was provided by FWCP through coordination from SERNbc. Effectiveness monitoring at the site was conducted in 2024 with the structure in stable condition with no maintenance required at the time of reporting. Lessons learned from the work - to be leveraged towards future projects - include reducing the amount of riprap material placed within the bankfull channel width and replanting of areas where riparian vegetation is removed during construction. Resampling of fish at the restoration and reference sites in future years is recommended to build our understanding of fish use, movement and health in the subject streams. Acquisition of additional aerial imagery in the future is also recommended so that imagery and elevation models can be compared with data collected immediately following replacement (2022) to evaluate stream morphology changes and riparian recovery since construction. fpr::fpr_table_fish_site() Table 4.13: Fish sampling site summary for 125179. site passes ef_length_m ef_width_m area_m2 enclosure 125179_ds_ef1 1 35 3.7 129.5 partial enclosure 125179_us_ef1 1 40 2.4 96.0 partial enclosure fpr::fpr_table_fish_density() Table 4.14: Fish sampling density results summary for 125179. local_name species_code life_stage catch density_100m2 nfc_pass 125179_ds_ef1 Rainbow Trout adult 1 0.8 FALSE 125179_ds_ef1 Rainbow Trout fry 2 1.5 FALSE 125179_ds_ef1 Rainbow Trout parr 12 9.3 FALSE 125179_us_ef1 Rainbow Trout fry 4 4.2 FALSE 125179_us_ef1 Rainbow Trout juvenile 2 2.1 FALSE 125179_us_ef1 Rainbow Trout parr 6 6.2 FALSE * nfc_pass FALSE means fish were captured in final pass indicating more fish of this species/lifestage may have remained in site.

Crossing 198669 is the responsibility of the Ministry of Transportation and Infrastructure (chris_culvert_id: 1996861). Background At this location, Tributary to McLeod Lake is a third order stream and drains a watershed of approximately 6.8km2. The watershed ranges in elevation from a maximum of 1004m to 682m near the crossing (Table 4.17). In 2023, crossing 198669 was assessed with a fish passage assessment and was prioritized for follow-up with a habitat confirmation assessment due to the extremely poor condition and size of the culvert, and the presence of quality habitat observed upstream (Irvine and Winterscheidt 2024).

The stream had frequent pools, good cover, and abundant gravels, providing medium value habitat for overwintering and spawning fish. Beaver activity was visible and fish were observed the entire length of the survey (Figure 4.12). The average channel width was 3.4m, the average wetted width was 1.5m, and the average gradient was 1.6%.Total cover amount was rated as abundant with undercut banks dominant. Cover was also present as small woody debris, large woody debris, deep pools, and overhanging vegetation.The dominant substrate was cobbles with gravels sub-dominant. Stream Characteristics Upstream of Crossing 198669 The stream was surveyed upstream from crossing 198669 for 550m (Figure 4.13). Abundant gravels were present throughout the lower section, providing suitable spawning habitat. Near the powerline corridor, substrate composition transitioned to predominantly fines. Approximately 100m upstream of the transmission line, a 1.2m high beaver dam created a backwatered area. Numerous fish, ranging from 40-120mm, were observed throughout the surveyed section up to the beaver dam. Upstream of the impounded area, the stream returned to predominantly gravel substrates with frequent pools up to 40cm deep. The dominant substrate was gravels with fines sub-dominant.The average channel width was 3.7m, the average wetted width was 2.4m, and the average gradient was 2.5%.Total cover amount was rated as moderate with undercut banks dominant. Cover was also present as small woody debris, large woody debris, deep pools, and overhanging vegetation. The habitat was rated as medium value for salmonid spawning and rearing. Structure Remediation and Cost Estimate Should restoration/maintenance activities proceed, replacement of the Hart Highway crossing with a bridge (4.5 m span) is recommended. At the time of reporting in 2025, the cost of the work is estimated at $ 1,500,000. Conclusion Approximately 5km of bull trout rearing habitat is modelled upstream, and the habitat was rated as medium value for anadromous spawning and rearing. The culvert was in extremely poor condition, with a deep outlet pool and significant erosion around the pipe inlet, indicating that the culvert is severely undersized for the stream. The 0.36m outlet drop likely inhibits juvenile fish passage. The crossing is a moderate priority for replacement. Due to this crossing being situated on the Hart Highway, construction would be complex and costly. tab_hab_summary |&gt; dplyr::filter(Site %in% c(my_site)) |&gt; fpr::fpr_kable(caption_text = paste0(&quot;Summary of habitat details for PSCIS crossings &quot;, my_site, &quot;.&quot;), scroll = F) Table 4.20: Summary of habitat details for PSCIS crossings 198669.

A total of 70 fish were captured downstream and 20 fish were captured upstream, all of which were rainbow trout (Figure 4.17). Structure Remediation and Cost Estimate If there are no plans for further logging in the area, removing the crossing and deactivating the road should be considered as a fish passage remediation option. If logging activities are planned to continue and restoration/maintenance activities proceed, replacement of the Kerry Lake FSR crossing with a bridge (15 m span) is recommended. At the time of reporting in 2025, the cost of the work is estimated at $ 450,000. Conclusion Approximately 2.3km of bull trout rearing habitat is modelled upstream, and the habitat was rated as medium value for anandromous spawning and rearing. The 0.34m outlet drop at PSCIS crossing 198692 likely inhibits juvenile anandromous fish passage and the crossing is rated as a high priority for replacement. Located on a low-traffic forest service road, remediation of this crossing would not require significant involvement. The road falls under the tenure of the Ministry of Forests, and if there are no plans for further logging in the area, removing the crossing and deactivating the road could be considered as a fish passage remediation option. If logging activities are planned to continue, opportunities should be explored to collaborate with road tenure holders to replace the crossing. tab_hab_summary |&gt; dplyr::filter(Site %in% c(my_site)) |&gt; fpr::fpr_kable(caption_text = paste0(&quot;Summary of habitat details for PSCIS crossings &quot;, my_site, &quot;.&quot;), scroll = F) Table 4.24: Summary of habitat details for PSCIS crossings 198692.
