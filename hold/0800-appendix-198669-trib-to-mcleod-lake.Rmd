## Site Location {.unnumbered}

PSCIS crossing `r as.character(my_site)` is located within the Crooked River watershed near the 7km mark of `r fpr_my_pscis_info(col_pull = road_name)`. The crossing lies approximately `r round(fpr::fpr_my_bcfishpass(col_pull = downstream_route_measure)*0.001, 1)` km upstream of where the stream flows northwest into Kerry Lake, on the northwestern side of the lake. The Forest Tenure Layer indicates that the Ministry of Forests is responsible for the road at this crossing location.

<br>


## Background {.unnumbered}

At crossing `r as.character(my_site)`, `r fpr::fpr_my_pscis_info()` is a
`r fpr::fpr_my_bcfishpass() %>% english::ordinal()` order stream with an
upstream watershed area of approximately
`r fpr::fpr_my_wshd()`km^2^. The watershed ranges in elevation from
a maximum of `r fpr::fpr_my_wshd(col = 'elev_max')`m to
`r fpr::fpr_my_wshd(col = 'elev_site')`m near the crossing (Table
\@ref(tab:tab-wshd-198669)). Prior to this assessment, there was no fisheries information regarding this stream.

NEED TO UPDATE

Habitat modelling outputs from `bcfishpass` indicated only 400m of habitat accessible to steelhead or coho (stream gradients <20% and 15%) and no habitat of high intrinsic potential for either species (gradients <8.5% for steelhead and <5.5% for coho).  Outputs are presented in Table
\@ref(tab:tab-culvert-bcfp-198669). A map of the watershed is provided in
map attachment

## Stream Characteristics at Crossing `r as.character(my_site)` {.unnumbered}

At the time of the 2024 assessment, PSCIS crossing `r as.character(my_site)` was
un-embedded, non-backwatered and ranked as a
`r fpr::fpr_my_pscis_info(col_pull = barrier_result) %>% stringr::str_to_lower()` to upstream fish passage according to the provincial protocol
[@moe2011Fieldassessment] (Table \@ref(tab:tab-culvert-198669)). The culvert had a substantial outlet drop of 0.3m and an outlet pool with a depth of 0.8m. The water temperature was `r fpr::fpr_my_habitat_info(loc = "ds", col_pull = 'temperature_c')`$^\circ$C,
pH was `r fpr::fpr_my_habitat_info(loc = "ds", col_pull = 'p_h')` and
conductivity was `r fpr::fpr_my_habitat_info(loc = "ds", col_pull = 'conductivity_m_s_cm')`uS/cm.

NEED TO UPDATE
## Stream Characteristics Downstream {.unnumbered}

`r fpr_my_survey_dist(loc = 'ds')`. `r fpr_my_habitat_paragraph(loc = 'ds')` The stream was noted as having good flow and containing pockets of gravel suitable for spawning `r if(gitbook_on){knitr::asis_output("(Figure \\@ref(fig:photo-198669-01)).")}else(knitr::asis_output("(Figure \\@ref(fig:photo-198669-d01))."))` Deep pools were infrequent and the morphology was step-pool cobble. The habitat was rated as `r fpr::fpr_my_priority_info(loc = 'ds') %>% stringr::str_to_lower()` value suitable for salmonid rearing and spawning.

## Stream Characteristics Upstream {.unnumbered}

`r fpr_my_survey_dist(loc = 'us')` to a point where gradients increased to 20% `r if(gitbook_on){knitr::asis_output("(Figure \\@ref(fig:photo-198669-02)).")}else(knitr::asis_output("(Figure \\@ref(fig:photo-198669-d01))."))` `r fpr_my_habitat_paragraph(loc = 'us')` There was good flow volume in the area surveyed and step-pool cascades (<1m high) created by large woody debris present throughout and pockets of gravel present suitable for spawning. The habitat was rated as `r fpr::fpr_my_priority_info(loc = 'us') %>% stringr::str_to_lower()` value with moderate rearing potential for dolly varden.

NEED TO UPDATE
## Fish Sampling {.unnumbered}

Electrofishing was conducted at two sites below and two sites above the crossing with results summarised in Tables \@ref(tab:tab-fish-site-198669) - \@ref(tab:tab-fish-dens-198669) and Figure
\@ref(fig:plot-fish-box-198669). A total of `r tab_fish_summary %>% filter(site_id == paste0(my_site, '_ds')) %>% group_by(site_id) %>% janitor::adorn_totals() %>% filter(site_id == 'Total') %>% pull(count_fish)` dolly varden were captured downstream, and `r tab_fish_summary %>% filter(site_id == paste0(my_site, '_us')) %>% group_by(site_id) %>% janitor::adorn_totals() %>% filter(site_id == 'Total') %>% pull(count_fish)` dolly varden were captured upstream. Multiple fish captured had deteriorating purple gill plates and unusual round black spots `r if(gitbook_on){knitr::asis_output("(Figures \\@ref(fig:photo-198669-03) - \\@ref(fig:photo-198669-04)).")}else(knitr::asis_output("(Figures \\@ref(fig:photo-198669-d02))."))` All fish captured with a fork length greater than 60mm were tagged with Passive Integrated Transponders (PIT tags) with data stored [here](`r paste0(params$repo_url, "blob/main/data/2023/habitat_confirmations.xls")`).

NEED TO UPDATE
## Structure Remediation and Cost Estimate {.unnumbered}

Should restoration/maintenance activities proceed, replacement of PSCIS crossing `r as.character(my_site)` with a bridge (`r fpr::fpr_my_pscis_info(col_pull = recommended_diameter_or_span_meters)`m span) is recommended. At the time of reporting in 2024, the cost of the work is estimated at \$`r format(fpr::fpr_my_cost_estimate(), big.mark = ',')`.


After discussions with BC Timber Sales (BCTS), they are exploring the feasibility of replacing this culvert and securing funding for the costs, as they are interested in land further down the Kerry Lake FSR. However, Sinclair indicated that recovering replacement costs through the appraisal system () stumpage rebates) is not feasible.

<br>

NEED TO UPDATE
## Conclusion {.unnumbered}

PSCIS crossing `r as.character(my_site)` is located on a steeper, colder water stream providing medium value habitat for dolly varden in the areas surveyed. Habitat modelling and ground measurements of gradient upstream of the `r fpr_my_pscis_info(col_pull = road_name)` were slightly above the selected threshold for high intrinsic potential for steelhead rearing (>8.5%) with averaged values at 10%.  As these relatively steep gradients drain a relatively high elevation watershed it may be most suitable for dolly varden. The site was rated as a `r fpr::fpr_my_priority_info(col_pull = priority) %>% stringr::str_to_lower()` 
priority for replacement containing `r fpr::fpr_my_priority_info() %>% stringr::str_to_lower()` value for salmonid rearing and spawning. As noted earlier, multiple fish captured had deteriorating purple gill plates and unusual round black spots potentially indicating some sort of natural or anthropogenic contaminants draining into the watershed.
