# Tributary to Missinka River - 125179 - Appendix {- #trib-to-missinka}


## Site Location {.unnumbered}

PSCIS crossing `r as.character(my_site)` is located on a `r fpr_my_pscis_info(dat = form_monitoring, site = my_site)`, between kilometer 3 and 4 of `r fpr_my_pscis_info(dat = form_monitoring, col_pull = road_name, site = my_site)`. The crossing is located approximately 660m east of PSCIS crossing 125180 and joins this adjacent stream just before emptying into the Missinka River, approximately 1km downstream. At the location of this crossing, the road is the responsibility of the Winton Global Lumber Ltd. R01821 51A. The crossing is within the Parsnip River watershed group.

<br>

## Background {.unnumbered}

At this location, `r fpr::fpr_my_pscis_info(dat = form_monitoring)` is a
`r fpr::fpr_my_bcfishpass() |>english::ordinal()` order stream and drains a watershed of approximately
`r fpr::fpr_my_wshd()`km^2^. The watershed ranges in elevation from
a maximum of `r fpr::fpr_my_wshd(col = 'elev_max')`m to
`r fpr::fpr_my_wshd(col = 'elev_min')`m near the crossing (Table
\@ref(tab:tab-wshd-125179)).

<br>

In 2018, the Missinka River watershed was designated as a fisheries sensitive watershed under the authority of the Forest and Range Practices Act due to significant downstream fisheries values and watershed sensitivity [@beaudry2013Assessmentassignmenta]. Special management is required in the crossingâ€™s watershed to protect habitat for bull trout and arctic grayling and includes measures (among others) to limit equivalent clearcut area, reduce impacts to natural stream channel morphology, retain old growth attributes and maintain fish habitat/movement. 

<br>

The site was originally prioritized for replacement in 2019 by @irvine2020ParsnipRiver, following a habitat confirmation assessment
which can be found [here](https://www.newgraphenvironment.com/Parsnip_Fish_Passage/03_Parsnip_report_125179.html). In the summer of 2022, the crossing was replaced with a 15m steel girder permanent bridge with modular timber decks [@irvine_winterscheidt2023RestoringFish]. Detailed background information regarding this crossing can be found in the 2022 report [here](https://www.newgraphenvironment.com/fish_passage_peace_2022_reporting/results-and-discussion.html#tributary-to-missinka-river---pscis-crossing-125179). A map of the watershed is provided in map attachment [`r fpr::fpr_my_bcfishpass(col_pull = dbm_mof_50k_grid)`](`r fpr::fpr_my_mapsheet(wshd = "parsnip", archive_date = "2022-05-27")`).

```

## Monitoring {.unnumbered}

In 2024, crews revisited the site for monitoring purposes, with results summarised in Table \@ref(tab:tab-monitoring-125179). A significant amount of riprap material was present within the channel in the road right-of-way, and there did not appear to have been any riparian planting conducted during construction. The structure appeared stable with no maintenance required at the time of reporting. Electrofishing was performed upstream and downstream, with results summarised in the section below.

<br>

Photos showing a comparison of the culvert assessment conducted in 2019 versus the completed bridge construction in 2024 are presented in `r if(gitbook_on){knitr::asis_output("Figures \\@ref(fig:photo-125179-01) - \\@ref(fig:photo-125179-02).")}else(knitr::asis_output("Figure \\@ref(fig:photo-125261-d02)."))` Aerial imagery surveys were conducted with a remotely piloted aircraft in 2022 and the resulting images were stitched into orthomosaics, which can be found [here](https://www.newgraphenvironment.com/fish_passage_peace_2022_reporting/results-and-discussion.html#tributary-to-missinka-river---pscis-crossing-125179).

## Fish Sampling {.unnumbered}

```

Electrofishing was conducted downstream and upstream of crossing `r as.character(my_site)` on `r fpr_my_pscis_info(dat = form_monitoring, col_pull = road_name, site = my_site)` with results summarised in Tables \@ref(tab:tab-fish-site-125179) - \@ref(tab:tab-fish-dens-125179) and Figure \@ref(fig:plot-fish-box-125179). A total of `r tab_fish_summary |> filter(site_id == paste0(my_site, '_ds')) |> group_by(site_id) |> janitor::adorn_totals() |> filter(site_id == 'Total') |> pull(count_fish)` fish were captured downstream and `r tab_fish_summary |> filter(site_id == paste0(my_site, '_us')) |> group_by(site_id) |> janitor::adorn_totals() |> filter(site_id == 'Total') |> pull(count_fish)` fish were captured upstream, all of which were rainbow trout `r if(gitbook_on){knitr::asis_output("(Figures \\@ref(fig:photo-125179-03) - \\@ref(fig:photo-125179-04)).")}else(knitr::asis_output("(Figures \\@ref(fig:photo-125179-d02))."))`

<br>

As per the 2022 recommendations, electrofishing was conducted downstream and upstream at PSCIS crossing 125180, a similarly sized stream located approximately 660m east of the subject crossing, where culverts were ranked as barriers in 2019 and sampling was recommended to provide reference site data for comparison [@irvine_winterscheidt2023RestoringFish; @irvine2020ParsnipRiver]. Fish lengths and weights were recorded, and all fish with a fork length greater than 60mm were tagged with Passive Integrated Transponders (PIT tags) with data stored [here](r paste0(params$repo_url, "blob/main/data/2024_fish_data_tags_joined.csv")). Additionally, the downstream site was resampled a few days later (`125180_ds_ef2`), but only fish lengths were documented, with no PIT tagging or weighing conducted. 

<br>

Electrofishing results from all sampling events at crossing `r as.character(my_site2)` are summarised in Tables \@ref(tab:tab-fish-site-125180) - \@ref(tab:tab-fish-dens-125180) and Figure \@ref(fig:plot-fish-box-125179). A total of `r tab_fish_summary |> filter(site_id == paste0(my_site2, '_ds') & ef == "ef1") |> group_by(site_id) |> janitor::adorn_totals() |> filter(site_id == 'Total') |> pull(count_fish)` fish were captured downstream during the first sampling event (`125180_ds_ef1`), and `r tab_fish_summary |> filter(site_id == paste0(my_site2, '_us')) |> group_by(site_id) |> janitor::adorn_totals() |> filter(site_id == 'Total') |> pull(count_fish)` fish were captured upstream, all of which were rainbow trout `r if(gitbook_on){knitr::asis_output("(Figures \\@ref(fig:photo-125179-05) - \\@ref(fig:photo-125179-06)).")}else(knitr::asis_output("(Figures \\@ref(fig:photo-125179-d03))."))` During the second downstream sampling event (`125180_ds_ef2`), a total of `r tab_fish_summary |> filter(site_id == paste0(my_site2, '_ds') & ef == "ef2") |> group_by(site_id) |> janitor::adorn_totals() |> filter(site_id == 'Total') |> pull(count_fish)` rainbow trout were captured.

## Conclusion {.unnumbered}

Restoration of fish passage at crossing `r as.character(my_site)` was restored in the summer of 2022 with a 15m steel girder permanent bridge with modular timber decks. Partial funding for the project was provided by FWCP through coordination from SERNbc. Replacement of the crossing will provide access to habitat blocked to upstream migrating fish for likely 10 - 20
years (timeline depending on the rate of down cutting caused by the outlet drops) and the stream has no other anthropogenic
obstructions to fish passage.

<br>

Resampling of fish at the site in future years of the project is recommended to build our understanding of fish use,
movement and health in the stream providing valuable data for monitoring the effectiveness of the crossing replacement.
Additionally, yearly acquisition of aerial imagery is recommended so that imagery and 3D
models generated from the data can be compared to products generated from data gathered in 2023 before the replacement. These comparisons will
be useful for communications related to the project as well as for providing insight into changes in stream morphology,
effectiveness of environmental management plans and site rehabilitation efforts following construction.
