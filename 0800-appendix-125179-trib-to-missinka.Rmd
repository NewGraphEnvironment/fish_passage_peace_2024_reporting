# Tributary to Missinka River - 125179 - Appendix {- #trib-to-missinka}


## Site Location {.unnumbered}

PSCIS crossing `r as.character(my_site)` is located on a `r fpr_my_pscis_info(dat = form_monitoring, site = my_site)`, between kilometer 3 and 4 of `r fpr_my_pscis_info(dat = form_monitoring, col_pull = road_name, site = my_site)`. The crossing is located approximately 660m east of PSCIS crossing 125180 and joins this adjacent stream just before emptying into the Missinka River, approximately 1km downstream. At the crossing location, the road is the responsibility of Sinclar Forest Group R01821 51A. The crossing is within the Parsnip River watershed group.

<br>

## Background {.unnumbered}

At the crossing location, `r fpr::fpr_my_pscis_info(dat = form_monitoring)` is a
`r fpr::fpr_my_bcfishpass() |>english::ordinal()` order stream and drains a watershed of approximately
`r fpr::fpr_my_wshd()`km^2^. The watershed ranges in elevation from
a maximum of `r fpr::fpr_my_wshd(col = 'elev_max')`m to
`r fpr::fpr_my_wshd(col = 'elev_min')`m near the crossing (Table
\@ref(tab:tab-wshd-125179)).

<br>

In 2018, the Missinka River watershed was designated as a fisheries sensitive watershed under the authority of the Forest and Range Practices Act due to significant downstream fisheries values and watershed sensitivity [@beaudry2013Assessmentassignmenta]. Special management is required in the crossingâ€™s watershed to protect habitat for bull trout and arctic grayling and includes measures (among others) to limit equivalent clearcut area, reduce impacts to natural stream channel morphology, retain old growth attributes and maintain fish habitat/movement. 

<br>

The site was originally prioritized for replacement in 2019 by @irvine2020ParsnipRiver, following a habitat confirmation assessment
which can be found [here](https://www.newgraphenvironment.com/Parsnip_Fish_Passage/03_Parsnip_report_125179.html). In the summer of 2022, Sinclar Forest Group replaced the crossing with a 15m steel girder permanent bridge with modular timber decks [@irvine_winterscheidt2023RestoringFish]. In addition to @irvine2020ParsnipRiver - post-replacement documentation regarding this crossing can also be found in the 2022 report [here](https://www.newgraphenvironment.com/fish_passage_peace_2022_reporting/results-and-discussion.html#tributary-to-missinka-river---pscis-crossing-125179). A map of the watershed is provided in map attachment [`r fpr::fpr_my_bcfishpass(col_pull = dbm_mof_50k_grid)`](`r fpr::fpr_my_mapsheet(wshd = "parsnip", archive_date = "2022-05-27")`).

## Monitoring {.unnumbered}

### Effectiveness Monitoring Checklist

Monitoring results gathered on a effectiveness monitoring checklist are summarised in Table \@ref(tab:tab-monitoring-125179). In general - the structure appeared stable with no maintenance required at the time of reporting. Lessons learned from the work - to be leveraged towards future projects - include reducing the amount of riprap material placed within the bankfull channel width and replanting of areas where riparian vegetation is removed during construction. Photos showing a comparison of the culvert assessment conducted in 2019 versus the completed bridge construction in 2024 are presented in `r if(gitbook_on){knitr::asis_output("Figures \\@ref(fig:photo-125179-01) - \\@ref(fig:photo-125179-02).")}else(knitr::asis_output("Figure \\@ref(fig:photo-125261-d02)."))`.

### Fish Sampling {.unnumbered}

As per recommendations in @irvine2020ParsnipRiver and @irvine_winterscheidt2023RestoringFish - to provide reference site data for comparison, electrofishing was conducted not only at the site of the remediation - but also at PSCIS crossing 125180, a similarly sized culverted stream - located approximately 660m east of the subject crossing [@irvine_winterscheidt2023RestoringFish; @irvine2020ParsnipRiver]. Another site (PSCIS crossing 125186) was also scoped for potential as as reference site - however the stream was almost completely dry in 2024 (with the exception of the outlet pool and intermittent shallow pool sections).  

<br>

Upstream on the reference site (`125180_us_ef1`) - fish lengths and weights were recorded, and all fish with a fork length greater than 60mm were tagged with Passive Integrated Transponders (PIT tags - data stored [here](r paste0(params$repo_url, "blob/main/data/2024_fish_data_tags_joined.csv")). On the first sampling event downstream (`125180_ds_ef1`) - only species and length data was collected.  However, the same site was revisited a few days later (`125180_ds_ef2`) with length/weight collected and PIT tagging conducted. Results are summarised in Tables \@ref(tab:tab-fish-site-125179) - \@ref(tab:tab-fish-dens-125179) and Figure \@ref(fig:plot-fish-box-125179).

<br>

A total of `r tab_fish_summary |> filter(site_id == paste0(my_site2, '_ds') & ef == "ef1") |> group_by(site_id) |> janitor::adorn_totals() |> filter(site_id == 'Total') |> pull(count_fish)` rainbow trout were captured downstream during the first sampling event (`125180_ds_ef1`), and `r tab_fish_summary |> filter(site_id == paste0(my_site2, '_us')) |> group_by(site_id) |> janitor::adorn_totals() |> filter(site_id == 'Total') |> pull(count_fish)` rainbow trout were captured upstream `r if(gitbook_on){knitr::asis_output("(Figures \\@ref(fig:photo-125179-05) - \\@ref(fig:photo-125179-06)).")}else(knitr::asis_output("(Figures \\@ref(fig:photo-125179-d03))."))` During the second downstream sampling event (when PIT tagging was conducted - `125180_ds_ef2`), a total of `r tab_fish_summary |> filter(site_id == paste0(my_site2, '_ds') & ef == "ef2") |> group_by(site_id) |> janitor::adorn_totals() |> filter(site_id == 'Total') |> pull(count_fish)` rainbow trout were captured. The lower density of rainbow trout parr captured on the second round of sampling within the same section of stream is not surprising since disturbance of the site and handling of fish a few days earlier likely impacted the recapture rate.

<br>

## Conclusion {.unnumbered}
Fish passage at crossing `r as.character(my_site)` was restored in the summer of 2022 with a 15m steel girder permanent bridge with modular timber decks. Partial funding for the project was provided by FWCP through coordination from SERNbc. Effectiveness monitoring at the site was conducted in 2024 with the structure in stable condition with no maintenance required at the time of reporting. Lessons learned from the work - to be leveraged towards future projects - include reducing the amount of riprap material placed within the bankfull channel width and replanting of areas where riparian vegetation is removed during construction.

<br>

Resampling of fish at the restoration and reference sites in future years is recommended to build our understanding of fish use, movement and health in the subject streams.
Acquisition of additional aerial imagery in the future is also recommended so that imagery and elevation models can be compared with data collected immediately following replacement (2022) to evaluate stream morphology changes and riparian recovery since construction.
